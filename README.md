## About blueLRS
**blueLRS** is a secure, open-source radio link for remote control and telemetry applications.  
Forked from the **ExpressLRS** project, blueLRS is engineered specifically for **NDAA-compliant** and **defense-oriented** use cases, while preserving the performance, reliability, and open development ethos of the original ExpressLRS platform.

Developed and maintained by **Ewing Aerospace** and a dedicated open-source community, blueLRS pushes the boundaries of long-range, low-latency wireless control while ensuring that all components and dependencies meet **U.S. government compliance standards**.

## Support blueLRS
You can support blueLRS by:

- Contributing code, documentation, or compliance testing  
- Reporting bugs or validating new firmware features  
- Sharing your experience or helping others get started  

For those unable to contribute time but wishing to help sustain the project, donations are welcome.  
Contributions fund infrastructure, secure build systems, and specialized test hardware to ensure reliability and NDAA compliance.

## Project Transparency
All project funding and development activity are managed openly. Contributors and sponsors are publicly acknowledged, and full transparency is maintained regarding how resources are used to strengthen the project’s infrastructure and compliance tools.

## Website and Resources
Visit the **blueLRS website** for guides, firmware releases, and compliance documentation. You’ll
also find technical FAQs, integration tips, and developer resources.
For configuration, the **blueLRS Configurator** (a fork of the ExpressLRS Configurator) provides
an easy interface to set up supported hardware and apply NDAA-safe firmware updates.

## Community
Join the discussion on **Discord** or our **GitHub repository** to stay involved with ongoing 
development. The community welcomes new users, hardware developers, and compliance 
partners.

## Key Features
